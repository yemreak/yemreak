╔══ MY CODING RITUALS ══╗

├─ AI writes code (I don't)
├─ Claude/Cursor = real developer
├─ Scripts & automations = dopamine
├─ Building bots = meditation
├─ I search for formulas in EVERYTHING
├─ I formulate even human behavior
├─ Framework/pattern/equation thinking
├─ Vanilla code, no heavy libraries
├─ Night owl
├─ Darkness + silence = flow state
├─ 7 hour sprint → full stop → repeat
├─ Standing/walking while working
├─ Solving by talking to myself
├─ Debugging by explaining to Claude
├─ Obsessed with micro expressions
╚═ AI orchestration = current obsession

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
※ I seek the framework of everything
※ Music = pattern recognition fuel
※ AI = hands, I = brain
※ I automate everything

No caffeine • No manual coding • No 9-5

Same frequency? → ping me

True expertise is the ability to do the right thing **instantly, without thinking**—and with enough awareness to **explain it to others**.

## English Version

AI writes all my code. I just architect & automate.

    Speed freak. 7-hour sprint → dead stop → repeat.
    Reactive not planned. Idea hits → build immediately.
    Standing/walking/talking to myself while working.

Pattern recognition in everything (code, humans, systems).

    Night work. Darkness + silence = flow.
    Debugging = explaining to Claude out loud.
    Micro-expressions obsessed.

Vanilla only. No heavy frameworks.

    Own time. Own rules. Build whatever whenever.
    no 9-5. no caffeine. no manual coding.

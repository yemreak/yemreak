True expertise is the ability to do the right thing **instantly, without thinking**—and with enough awareness to **explain it to others**.

In 2020, I built a crypto arbitrage bot with $450. While showing my mom how Mario's coin sound played for profit notifications, the system started working. First year I became financially free, tested on 20+ exchanges, working on a few.

Then I tried manual trading - lost half of it. Everything fell apart when emotions kicked in. Since then, my sole focus: formulate emotions, turn them into systems.

For 6 years, I've been accumulating thought systems I gained while talking and working 12+ hours daily - first with blog and notes, then with ChatGPT/Claude. I converted my voice to text with Whisper, learned English in my own voice with Voice Clone. Since childhood puzzles, elementary school math formulas, high school trigonometry - I've always had a formula obsession.

Now I im getting close to understand* human behavior from AI behavior. I realized while having Claude Code write code with my voice - it's just like us, acts according to what it's exposed to, not what it's told. I'm building principles like zero documentation principle: don't explain, live the culture; don't teach everything, let it learn on the way (hook).

I built 30+ CLI tools but never monetized any. My goal isn't money, it's to eliminate friction between thought and code. I have a speed obsession - sometimes I do 7-hour sprints, can't stop myself. I work reactively and unplanned, if an idea comes I do it immediately.

My dream is simple: Talk/work with AIs in my dark room at night, design systems, and learn to control my own behaviors and thinking patterns in the design process. If I can control AI's behaviors, I can control my own behaviors with the thought systems I've accumulated over 6 years.

_nothing missing, nothing extra.._
